# Yelp Database Benchmarking

This repository contains the source code and setup instructions for our final project in UC Berkeley’s Data Engineering course.

## Project Overview

We benchmarked two data systems—PostgreSQL and PySpark—on the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). Our goal was to compare performance, storage costs, and usability across a set of representative queries. Key tasks included:

1. **Schema Design**: Created a relational schema in PostgreSQL and a corresponding plan for PySpark.
2. **Data Loading**: Ingested multi-gigabyte Yelp data locally.
3. **Benchmark Queries**: Tested query performance (time and memory), user ergonomics, and data-modeling flexibility.
4. **Analysis & Report**: Summarized findings to guide system selection for various business use cases.

## Repository Structure

- `postgresql/`: Scripts and instructions for setting up the PostgreSQL database, schemas, and sample queries.
- `pyspark/`: PySpark notebooks and scripts to illustrate our benchmarking approach on the same Yelp data.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation, diagrams, and notes on data modeling.
- `README.md`: This overview document.

## Confidential Report

Our full write-up, including detailed performance metrics and analysis, is private. **Please contact me** if you would like to access it.
